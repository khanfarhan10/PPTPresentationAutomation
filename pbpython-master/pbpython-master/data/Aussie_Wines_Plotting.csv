128181,Australia,"This medium-bodied wine boasts aromas reminiscent of trading-card bubble gum. Is that even still a thing? It's vaguely cherry-like, with hints of baby powder, yet completely dry and refreshing, with a crisp, clean finish.

128182,Australia,"This traditional blend of five Bordeaux varieties comes across as tight and streamlined, lacking much texture or richness.

128183,Australia,"This medium-bodied Chardonnay is a bit tart and austere.

128264,Australia,"For a wine that's 100% Mourvèdre, this has pretty tame tannins, the suppleness and creamy texture helping to balance some of the crisp acids and tart red berry notes. Varietal cola and tree bark aromas and flavors add complexity to this structured but approachable red that should drink well for at least the next 5–8 years.",The Twentyeight Road,89,35.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,D'Arenberg 2006 The Twentyeight Road Mourvèdre (McLaren Vale),Mourvèdre,D'Arenberg,#83D34B
128278,Australia,"Savvy shoppers may be able to find this for about $20, making it an excellent deal in a full-bodied, structured red wine.

128434,Australia,"A remarkable effort, especially considering how difficult the 2011 vintage was in South Australia. Floral notes emerge on the nose, dressing up hints of raspberry compote, while the medium- to full-bodied palate delivers raspberries, cherries, cinnamon, clove and pepper. The tannins on the finish are fine and silky.

128983,Australia,"Of all the Clarendon Hills 2008 Syrahs, the Moritz probably offers the best value. It's plummy, dark and intense, with savory overtones of meat and spice that complement the wine's full body and creamy texture. The long finish echoes with hints of coffee, meat and plummy fruit.

129119,Australia,"In the 2012 vintage, Cullen's entry-level red wine is an assemblage of 55% Merlot, 29% Malbec and 16% Petit Verdot.

129210,Australia,"This is truly prickly, with a slight spritz of CO2 acting to perk up the lime, green apple and pineapple aromas and flavors.

129368,Australia,"This wine shows much less oak influence than Pepik's Zdar bottling, but in this case that's a good thing. The fruit is herbal and perhaps a bit tomatoey, but there's enough cherry to hold things together, with smoke and sous-bois notes for complexity.

129389,Australia,"Banrock Station's 2006 Shiraz is a throwback to the kind of super value Australian wines used to provide with more regularity. For $5, consumers get a decently textured, supple wine with plenty of forward blueberry and plum fruit and touches of chocolate and pepper.
